# Research Edge Series

> **Rigorous Research Methodology for Social Scientists and Market Researchers**

By **Vinay Thakur**

## About the Series

The Research Edge Series provides evidence-based guidance for researchers who want to move beyond casual data collection to rigorous research practice. Each installment focuses on fundamental methodological challenges and their solutions, helping you avoid common pitfalls that destroy research validity.

## Core Principles

• **Theoretical Rigor:** Every recommendation is grounded in established research methodology
• **Practical Application:** Complex concepts explained through real-world examples  
• **Error Prevention:** Focus on avoiding systematic biases that compound across studies
• **Actionable Insights:** Move from "interesting findings" to strategic decisions

## Article Index

### [#001: Why Consumers Unconsciously Mislead Us](./articles/001-unconscious-consumer-behavior.md)
**Understanding Post-Hoc Rationalization in Consumer Research**

Discover why consumers do not have conscious access to their decision-making processes and how post-hoc rationalization creates misleading research insights. Learn why direct "why" questions fail and how expert researchers use perception association methods to uncover real decision drivers.

**Key Topics:**
• Post-hoc rationalization and System 1 vs System 2 thinking
• Why direct questions about decision reasons fail
• Perception association research techniques
• Business impact of misunderstanding decision drivers

**Available Formats:** [📄 Article](./articles/001-unconscious-consumer-behavior.md) | [📁 PDF](./assets/001-unconscious-consumer-behavior.pdf)

### [#002: The Science of Proper Measurement](./articles/002-measurement-fundamentals.md)
**Moving Beyond Casual Surveys to Rigorous Research Design**

Learn why most research fails before data collection even begins. Discover the fundamental distinction between reflective and formative constructs, understand how measurement model misspecification can inflate your findings by 400%, and see how to fix the most common survey design errors.

**Key Topics:**
• The consumer-as-researcher fallacy
• Reflective vs. formative measurement models
• Systematic bias in causal attribution
• Step-by-step measurement design

**Available Formats:** [📄 Article](./articles/002-measurement-fundamentals.md) | [📁 PDF](./assets/002-research-edge-series-measurement-fundamentals.pdf)

### [#003: The Sample Size Paradox](./articles/003-sample-size-paradox.md)
**Why Statistical Precision Trumps Intuitive Mathematics**

Contemporary business research suffers from a fundamental misunderstanding of statistical sampling theory, leading to systematic over-sampling and resource misallocation. Discover why population size bears minimal relationship to required sample sizes and how precision requirements should drive sampling decisions.

**Key Topics:**
• The precision framework: Astronomical vs. engineering measurement standards
• Mathematical reality vs. intuitive logic in population sampling
• International research standards from WHO and UNICEF
• Decision frameworks for optimal sample size determination

**Available Formats:** [📄 Article](./articles/003-sample-size-paradox.md) | [📁 PDF](./assets/Sample%20Precision.pdf)
